# Meal-App-Project-2
Created a meal app to store and search for meals. Use ONLY vanilla JavaScript, no libraries or frameworks allowed for JavaScript (you can use any CSS framework like Bootstrap).

I have used- TheMeal API: https://www.themealdb.com/api.php as Database (which is retrived).

Features of my Meal App:

Home Page
-Search Button for Searching any meal from the API with the ingredient and display the search results on the frontend (as I type the search results it will update, just like Google does for suggestions).
-Each search result of the meal should have a Add to favourite button, clicking on which the meal should be added to “My favourite meals” (a list).
-On clicking any particular search result (any meal), It will open a new page with more information about that meal(meal page).

Meal Detail Page
-I have created a Modal for Meal Deatils Page i.e View Recipie, it will show information about the meal like its name, photo, instructions, Watch Video etc.
-I have added Close Button to close the Meal Details Modal.

My favourite meals Page
-I have Reacted a Modal for Displaying the My Faviourite Meal's
-It will Display a list of all the favourite meals.
-Added to Favourite Meals are displayed as list persistent (It will have the same number of meals before and after closing the browser/refreshing the browser).
-I have added a Remove button in my favourites meal button: Each meal will have remove from favourites button, clicking on which should remove that meal from the list.
